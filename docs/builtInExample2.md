## Pipeline description
This example demostrates how bivariate analysis can be used for the analysis of molecular data. The input to this pipeline are two scalar fields: the electron density field denoted as `log(Rho)` and the [reduced density gradeint](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00268976.2015.1123777) denoted by `log(s)` for a simple molecule called 1,2-ethanediol.

First, usual univariate scalar field analysis method is used for the analysis. An isosurafce is extracted in `log(Rho)` field which helps in identification of the location of atoms in the molecule, see black surfaces in the lower left panel of the screenshot above. Similarly, an isosurafce in `log(s)` identifies the covalent bonds.

Next we perform bivariate analysis which looks at the joint behaviour `log(Rho)` and `log(s)` rather than looking at these scalar fields individually. We first compute the [ContinuousScatterPlot](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkContinuousScatterPlot.html) for this bivariate data. This is shown in the top panel of the screenshot above. We then project the isosrfaces extrated earlier during univariate analysis in the range space using [ProjectionFromField](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkProjectionFromField.html). As expected these isosurfaces project to two line segments which are perpendicular to each other and parallel to the X axis and Y axis, repectively.

Note how the continuous scatter plot spreads largely diagonally down from top-left corner to bottom-right in the range space with four distinct protrusions coming out on the top and bottom. These protrusions are of interest. We manually select polylines in the range space at these four protrusions and use them for extraction of fiber surfaces using [FiberSurface](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkFiberSurface.html). 

Two of the fiber surfaces correspond to the atoms in the molecule, one of which identifies the Oxygen atoms (red surfaces in bottom right panel of the screenshot) while the other surface identifies the Carbon atoms (grey surfaces in bottom right panel of the screenshot). The other two fiber surfaces identify the bonds or interaction sites in the molecule. One surface clearly identifies the covalent bonds (blue surfaces in bottom right panel of the screenshot), while the other identifies a non-covalent interaction site in the molecule (light green surface in bottom right panel of the screenshot). Note that using univariate analysis of the data it is not straightforward to distinguish between different type of atoms and different types of bonds. However, it is much easier to do so using bivariate data analysis.

Lastly, we also compute the [JacobiSet](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkJacobiSet.html) for the bivariate data and project it in the range space. Notice how it aligns with the continuous scatter plot and identifies the boundaries and the distinguishable curves within it.

## ParaView
