# Geometry Approximation 

![Geometry Approximation Example Image](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/img/gallery/geometryApproximation.jpg)

## Pipeline description
This example first loads the geometry of a stone.

A fake shadow is put on the stone mesh to give the mesh depth values. The stone object is placed within a sphere using [IcosphereFromObject](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkIcosphereFromObject.html). The object and the icosphere is then given to the [CinemaImaging](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkCinemaImaging.html) filter. It generates multiple images of the stone object, and the images are taken from cameras placed on the vertices of the icosphere.

 An approximation of the geometry is calculated from the images using [DepthImageBasedGeometryApproximation](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/doc/html/classttkDepthImageBasedGeometryApproximation.html). The approximated geometry can be extracted using the `Threshold` filter.


## ParaView
To reproduce the above screenshot, go to your [ttk-data](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data) directory and enter the following command:
``` bash
paraview --state=states/geometryApproximation.pvsm
```

## Python code

``` python  linenums="1"
--8<-- "python/geometryApproximation.py"
```

To run the above Python script, go to your [ttk-data](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data) directory and enter the following command:
``` bash
pvpython python/geometryApproximation.py
```


## Inputs
- [stone.vtp](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/tree/dev/GroundWater.cdb/stone.vtp): a mesh of the stone around the ground water.

## Outputs
- `CinemaImages.vtm`: the images from the cameras given in a multiblock.
- `GeometryApproximatedStone.vtm`: the reconstructed objected as a multiblock of meshes.
