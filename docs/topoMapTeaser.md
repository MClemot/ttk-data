## Pipeline description
This example illustrates the [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512) dimensionality reduction technique on a series of toy examples. [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512) is a projection algorithm (presented at IEEE VIS 2020) which strictly preserves the persistent connected components of the original data, or put differently, its hierarchy of clusters. Intuitively, with [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512), you have the guarantee that the "salient" clusters of your high-dimensional data are preserved while projecting it to lower dimensions.
 

Technically, [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512) provides the guarantee that the 0-dimensional persistent diagram of the Rips filtration of its output is strictly equal to that of its input. Alternatively, [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512) guarantees that the hierarchical clustering (with single linkage) of its output is strictly identical to that of its input. 

Three toys examples are provided as CSV ASCII files (one line per point, one column per dimension). These are point clouds in 3D, which [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512) projects down to 2D. Each of these point clouds illustrates a specific topological behavior.

The dataset [3blobs.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/3blobs.csv) contains 3 main clusters (one color per cluster in the above screenshot, top left), shaped like blobs.

The dataset [3rings.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/3rings.csv) contains 3 main clusters (one color per cluster in the above screenshot, top center), shaped as interleaved rings.

The dataset [2cavities.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/2cavities.csv) contains 2 main clusters (one color per cluster in the above screenshot, top right), one (in red) completely enclosed by the other (in blue).

For each of these datasets, [TopoMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01512) computes a 2D projection (corresponding bottom views in the above screenshot), which separates well the ground truth clusters (shown with colors).

## ParaView
To reproduce the above screenshot, go to your [ttk-data](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data) directory and enter the following command:
``` bash
paraview states/topoMapTeaser.pvsm
```

## Python code

``` python  linenums="1"
--8<-- "python/topoMapTeaser.py"
```

To run the above Python script, go to your [ttk-data](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data) directory and enter the following command:
``` bash
pvpython python/topoMapTeaser.py
```


## Inputs
- [3blobs.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/3blobs.csv): a 3D point cloud in CSV ASCII format (one line per point, one column per dimension), which exhibits 3 main clusters (in the shape of blobs).
- [3rings.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/3rings.csv): a 3D point cloud in CSV ASCII format (one line per point, one column per dimension), which exhibits 3 main clusters (in the shape of interleaved rings).
- [2cavities.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/2cavities.csv): a 3D point cloud in CSV ASCII format (one line per point, one column per dimension), which exhibits 2 main clusters (one completely enclosed by the other one).

## Outputs
- `3blobs_topoMap.csv`: the output 2D projection of the [3blobs.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/3blobs.csv) dataset in CSV ASCII format (one line per point, one column per dimension).
- `3rings_topoMap.csv`: the output 2D projection of the [3rings.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/3rings.csv) dataset in CSV ASCII form
at (one line per point, one column per dimension).
- `2cavities_topoMap.csv`: the output 2D projection of the [2cavities.csv](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-data/raw/dev/2cavities.csv) dataset in CSV ASCII form at (one line per point, one column per dimension).
